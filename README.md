# CSCI 447: Project 1 â€” Naive Bayes Algorithm

## TODO:

- Split Database into `training` sets & `prediction check` sets.
      - Can just take a single .data file, and partition it into a `training set` and a `validation set`.

## Environment Setup

- Install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section), and make sure you have access to use `conda --version` from the command line.

- In order to run our code, you must have the appropriate version of python and libraries installed.

- Open your command line of choice in the project directory and run the command: `conda install environment.yml`

- Then open the environment using the command `conda activate bayes`

- In the same command line, run `python Driver.py` to start the program.
