@brief     Given a number of folds k, and binned data, as well as bin_lengths,
           iterate over each bin and separate the data into two subsets, 
           training data and test_data. 
           Then classify the training data and calculate the probabilities.
           Run prediction on each row of the test_data set and return
           an array of guess results containing
           guess results associated with each bin,
           as every bin will be the test bin at some point.
